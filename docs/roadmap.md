More content?
- Gotta really pray about what to share and when
- Ultimately, this isn't up to me


Images for posts?
- This would draw a lot more attention to them; the current gradient isn't attractive, especially with images on the first two links
- Gotta make sure it's the right kind of attention; aggressive comic book style might not be best
- They're dreams, realistic images maybe isn't the right fit either
- Would probably want to set posts to have consistent aspect ratio
- Again, this isn't up to me
