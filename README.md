# MoriLink

MoriLink is a fork of [Treelink](https://github.com/trevortylerlee/treelink) that adds new features and improvements.

- Refreshed UI: icons in links, blog preview cards, gradient background, new icon set
- Optional contact form using [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com)
- More improvements on the way including featured links

## 🚀 Getting started

Run this in your terminal:
```bash
git clone github.com/mitchell-wallace/mori-link
cd mori-link
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

To use the contact form, you will need to get an access key from [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com). Add the access key to the `siteConfig.json` file.

Then read Treelink's [Quick start guide](https://docs.treelink.app/guides/quick-start/) to get started with customisation. Most content from Treelink's docs is still aplicable to MoriLink.

## ✨ Features

- Customizable, with premade themes for light and dark mode
- Custom OpenGraph images per post, with a fallback image
- Icon support for hundreds of sites
- RSS and sitemap generation
- Optional blog
- Optional contact form using [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com)

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`     | Installs dependencies                        |
| `pnpm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3030`  |
| `pnpm run build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `pnpm run preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying |

## 👀 Custom Favicon

To set up favicons for different devices, you can use [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). Download the generated files and place them in the `public` folder, and update the `Favicons.astro` file with the new file names using the snippet generated by the website.

## 🎨 Custom Icons

MoriLink uses [astro-icon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-icon) for icons, integrating with the [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) collection and supporting local SVGs.

### 🖼️ Local SVG Icons

You can use any SVGs as icons for your site. To do so, simply place custom SVGs in `src/icons/`. SVGs in this folder are available as icons using the filename (without `.svg`).

For example, if you have `src/icons/mylogo.svg`, use it like this:

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "icon": "mylogo"
  // ...
}
```

When adding new icons you will need to restart the Astro dev server for the icon to be available.

### ℹ️ Adding Additional Icons from Iconify

You can install additional icons from [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) by running `pnpm install @iconify-json/[icon-set-name]`. For example, to install Tabler icons, run the following:

```bash
pnpm install @iconify-json/tabler
```

Then use it like this:

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "icon": "tabler:a-b"
  // ...
}
```

Whenever you add new icons to `src/siteConfig.json`, restart the Astro dev server for icon to be available.
