In a large Adventist church in the Eastern United States, a revolutionary speaker arose. He preached a powerful message, and many who heard believed. This message spread and began to gain global attention, at which point opposition to this message began to arise. Somehow the name “DeepSeek” became associated with him.

As these debates circled, a question of diet was raised during the planning of a particular event. The plan had been that it would be all vegan and caffeine-free, including the exclusion of chocolate, and the menu would include lasagna. Questions were raised if Tim Tams could be used as part of a particular dessert, and at first they were considered, but then disregarded because they not only contain caffeine but also dairy and thus break both dietary restrictions across the event. An alternative suggestion was to use a certain kind of walnut in that dish. As the possibility was investigated, it was discovered that these particular walnuts can only be sourced from a particular part of China, a large island just off the coast. This would make the dish caffeine-free, however the organisers had missed the fact that this would somehow cause the dish to be merely vegetarian and no longer vegan, and so the proposal was abandoned.

Returning to the scene of the revolutionary speaker, his position to speak to his home church was ultimately revoked, and the church lived on without him. It was seen that though by word the church had assented to the man's teachings, it was seen that their lives did not reflect these teachings, and they did not live out the principles which were under discussion. They lived just as if they had never heard this man speak. Just as the false christs were put to death and their followers were scattered, so were this man's followers.

Comparing the shape of the island I saw with a map of China, the best match is Hainan. Taiwan is the wrong shape and it is debated whether it should be counted as part of China, and the other South sea islands are too small and far from the coast.

It is worth noting that in China it is relatively common to have pre-packaged flavoured nuts, which may sometimes contain artificial flavours or milk powder.

Also, note that the speaker seen in this dream, which may or may not serve simply as a parable, was a man whose teachings were disregarded by his local church when his right to speak was revoked. This is important to avoid misapplication.
