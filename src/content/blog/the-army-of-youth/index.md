Before the closing of the work, the youth must be inspired and equipped. This is the work of the Holy Spirit. I believe this dream is symbolic of the Holy Spirit speaking to youth worldwide.

There were a series of camp meetings, with youth gathered as sand on the seashore. There was one Speaker. These were the youth who were unreservedly committed to Christ. They kept coming back year after year. They did not make excuses of work or finances; they were all in.

Each year, there was a special gift given to all the youth. There were a range of different gifts, even including a form to fill out for free admission to the next meeting; this clearly destroyed the natural financial viability of these events, yet they continued unimpeded.

Then, one year, there was an option on a commitment card that I believe was equivalent to a decision for full time ministry. I had ticked the box, and we were then waiting around for what would happen next. A group of us were gathered into a classroom, the music classroom of Avondale High. We were waiting for the Teacher to tell us what next. There was something we progressively became occupied with figuring out (and rightly so), but I don't remember what it was.
