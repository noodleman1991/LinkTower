title: The Blue Woman and the Thief
description: Though the thief's movements appeared casual, they were very carefully calculated; and as soon as he determined that he would not shake her off any time soon, he struck; snatching the most valuable ornament he could find, he grabbed it and made a run for it, hoping to outrun and evade the woman.

I had this dream from the perspective of the thief, and it kind of reminded me of thieving in the Elders Scrolls games, but I know the thief is not me.

There was a grand, regal auditorium, with decorative archways, two storeys, and rooms and corridors branching off from this main area. The thief observed, and saw different groups with different colours and iconography. He did not hesitate, but immediately moved towards his target.

Entering the store, he was met by a woman dressed in blue. She kept a careful eye on him and followed his movements as he proceeded around the store, looking for golden objects, and weighing them in his hand to see how much of the weight of real gold they possessed. The thief sought to identify objects of value, of much gold, that he might steal them. As he weighed different objects, he was a little disappointed that none possessed the weight of pure solid gold, though some possessed it's outward sheen.

The woman followed him around the store, and he continued to move around the store in hope of shaking her off his tail, that perhaps she might become distracted, but she would not. Though the thief's movements appeared casual, they were very carefully calculated; and as soon as he determined that he would not shake her off any time soon, he struck; snatching the most valuable ornament he could find, he grabbed it and made a run for it, hoping to outrun and evade the woman.

The woman immediately pursued this outlaw, and did not let him outrun her. He reached a place where he hoped to hide, for there was a hidden trapdoor to go under the ruins of a burned-out house. Hoping to lose her as he darted in and out about the ruins, he once more made a carefully calculated yet brief attempt to lose her before suddenly descending through the trapdoor.

He had made it underneath without her seeing him, and she was now searching throughly to find him. The woman had help from others, men of excellent ability, and in almost no time they had identified the trapdoor, moved aside the debris obscuring its opening, and prepared to follow the thief in pursuit of reclaiming the precious object. The thief realised that his final daring move had failed, for below the surface he had nowhere left to run to.

In another scene, there was a large shopping complex, with a multi level carpark beside the shore of the sea, and a large pier which extended out over the waters and contained the bulk of the complex. There was a criminal on the loose, who came to kill, steal and destroy. He hid out of sight, and laid snares in the carpark for anyone unfortunate enough to stumble upon them.

The criminal did not work alone, but operated alongside his co-conspirators, who sought to ambush those on their way to the pier. They laid traps and snares; laying down that which looked like grass, and was a more vibrant green than the real thing, but was not grass, for it was a trap of destruction. However, they were not permitted to operate upon the pier itself; they were constrained by an authority they had no power to disobey.

The woman in blue is the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the church that has the law of God, and those who helped her are the holy angels, who excel in strength. The thief and criminal is Satan, and those who help him are the fallen angels, who are demons and unclean spirits.

The golden ornaments are those who profess to reflect Christ's character. The thief is only able to steal those who have the appearance of gold but not the substance or weight of gold. The woman, that is the church, is to watch carefully the movements of the thief, to guard against his attempts to snatch any soul away from the fold.

He is not permitted to ensnare nor steal on the pier itself, that is those whose hearts and minds are gven over to Christ, who have by faith claimed their ticket to be ferried over to the heavenly Canaan. Though he may torment them, he is not able to catch them nor steal them away from Christ, except should they step foot off the pier.
