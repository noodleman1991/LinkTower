*This is an example blog post written by AI. Don't read into it too deeply :)*

Quotd (pronounced "quoted") is a web application I built to make it easy to share meaningful Bible verses with others. The app allows you to create beautiful, shareable verse cards that you can send to friends and family.

## Features

The app includes several key features that make sharing verses simple and engaging:

- **Beautiful verse cards** with real photos of God's creation
- **Easy customisation** with quick, simple controls
- **Quick sharing** to social media and messaging apps *(coming soon)*
- **Daily verses** for regular inspiration *(coming soon)*

## Why I Built It

I wanted to create a tool that would make it easier for people to share their faith in a visually appealing way. Whether it's encouragement for a friend going through a difficult time or a daily reminder of God's promises, Quotd makes it simple to spread the word.

## Technology

Quotd is built with modern web technologies including SolidJS, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. The app is fully responsive and works great on both mobile and desktop devices.

Try it out for yourself and start sharing verses that inspire you!
