Quotd (Quote of the Day) is a web application I built to make it easy to share meaningful Bible verses with others. The app allows you to create beautiful, shareable verse cards that you can send to friends and family.

## Features

The app includes several key features that make sharing verses simple and engaging:

- **Beautiful verse cards** with customizable backgrounds and styling
- **Easy sharing** to social media and messaging apps
- **Verse search** to quickly find your favorite passages
- **Daily verses** for regular inspiration

## Why I Built It

I wanted to create a tool that would make it easier for people to share their faith in a visually appealing way. Whether it's encouragement for a friend going through a difficult time or a daily reminder of God's promises, Quotd makes it simple to spread the word.

## Technology

Quotd is built with modern web technologies including Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. The app is fully responsive and works great on both mobile and desktop devices.

Try it out for yourself and start sharing verses that inspire you!
