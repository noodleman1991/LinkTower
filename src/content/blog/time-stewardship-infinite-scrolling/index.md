# Time Stewardship in the Age of Infinite Scrolling

Time is humanity's most democratic resource—everyone receives exactly 24 hours daily. Yet modern technology, particularly infinite scroll interfaces, systematically steals this precious commodity. Biblical stewardship principles offer wisdom for redeeming time in the digital age. Understanding how platforms capture attention and applying Christian time stewardship helps believers live purposefully rather than reactively.

## The Biblical Foundation for Time Stewardship

Scripture treats time as a gift requiring faithful management. Psalm 90:12 requests: "Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom." Ephesians 5:15-16 counsels: "See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil." Colossians 4:5 similarly urges believers to walk in wisdom toward outsiders, "redeeming the time."

The word "redeeming" suggests buying back time—recovering what was lost or stolen. In an age of infinite scroll, this language proves remarkably apt. Time scrolling feeds is time literally stolen—hours vanish without conscious awareness or intentional use.

Ellen White wrote extensively about time stewardship: "Our time belongs to God. Every moment is His, and we are under the most solemn obligation to improve it to His glory... Of no talent He has given will He require a more strict account than of our time" (*Christ's Object Lessons*, p. 342).

She also warned about time-wasting: "Many are wasting opportunities which, if improved, would make them skillful workers for Christ. Those hours which are frittered away in vanity and inaction, if spent in acquiring knowledge and in doing good, would increase usefulness and happiness" (*Messages to Young People*, p. 148).

These principles, written before television or internet, apply with intensified relevance to digital age time thieves.

## The Design of Infinite Scroll

Infinite scroll interfaces—social media feeds, news sites, video platforms—eliminate natural stopping points. Traditional media had built-in endings: a newspaper had final page, a TV show concluded, a magazine finished. These endings prompted users to decide whether to continue consuming content or do something else.

Infinite scroll removes this decision point. Content loads continuously, seamlessly, endlessly. What was meant to be "quick check" becomes hour-long session because there's no moment prompting "should I stop?"

Additionally, algorithms curate content to maximize engagement (time spent on platform). Machine learning identifies exactly what content keeps each user scrolling longest—not what educates, edifies, or serves them best, but what holds attention. The result is personalized time-stealing optimized for each individual.

Platform designers openly discuss these tactics. Former Facebook president Sean Parker admitted: "The thought process that went into building these applications... was all about: 'How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?' And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while" (Axios interview, 2017).

This isn't accidental. Infinite scroll is intentional design choice to maximize time spent on platform, increasing advertising revenue. Users' wellbeing is secondary to engagement metrics.

## The True Cost of Scrolling Time

When infinite scroll steals an hour, what's actually lost?

**Spiritual communion**: Time that could have been spent in prayer, Bible study, or Christian service went instead to mindless consumption. Spiritual muscles atrophy when exercise time disappears.

**Relationship investment**: Undistracted conversation with spouse, quality time with children, meaningful connection with friends—all require time infinite scroll consumes. Relationships deteriorate when physical presence occurs without mental presence.

**Productive work**: Whether employment, home maintenance, creative projects, or volunteer service—all require time. Scrolling doesn't just waste time in abstract; it steals time from specific valuable activities.

**Rest and recreation**: True rest—reading, nature walks, naps, hobbies—restore energy. Scrolling feels like rest but often leaves users more depleted. Mistaking scrolling for recreation robs people of actual recovery time.

**Learning and growth**: The time spent scrolling curated content could develop skills, expand knowledge, or deepen understanding. Passive consumption replaces active learning.

**Physical health**: Exercise, meal preparation, and sleep all require time. Scrolling steals hours that health depends on.

Ellen White's concern about "time frittered away in vanity and inaction" describes scrolling perfectly. It's not rest (active recovery) nor productive labor (purposeful work), but time simply vanishing into void.

## Reclaiming Time Through Stewardship

Biblical stewardship principles applied to digital life:

**Intentionality over reactivity**: Before opening an app or site, ask: Why am I doing this? What specific purpose does this serve? How much time will I allocate? Without intention, platforms' design dictates usage.

**Time budgeting**: Just as financial stewardship involves budgeting money, time stewardship involves budgeting hours. Allocating specific time for various activities—work, family, worship, rest, recreation—leaves less vulnerable to infinite scroll's theft.

**Eliminating infinite scroll entirely**: For many, moderation proves impossible. Deleting apps or using website blockers removes the temptation. Abstinence from platforms engineered for addiction represents wise stewardship.

**Creating friction**: Making time-wasting harder helps break automatic habits. Logging out after each use, deleting apps and only accessing through browsers, using grayscale mode to reduce visual appeal—all create moments of choice rather than mindless habit.

**Accountability**: Sharing screen time reports with an accountability partner creates healthy pressure. Knowing someone will see how much time was scrolled encourages better choices.

**Sabbath technology rest**: Weekly 24-hour break from platforms resets patterns and demonstrates that life continues without constant connectivity.

## The Priority Hierarchy

Not all time uses are equally valuable. Stewardship requires prioritizing:

1. **Spiritual health**: Prayer, Scripture study, worship, Christian service
2. **Relationships**: Family, close friendships, church community
3. **Necessary work**: Employment, home care, education
4. **Physical health**: Exercise, meal preparation, adequate sleep
5. **Rest and recreation**: Genuine restoration, not mindless distraction
6. **Learning and growth**: Skill development, education, meaningful reading

Infinite scroll falls below all these categories yet often receives more time than items higher on the list. Stewardship means aligning time allocation with actual priorities.

Ellen White emphasized this: "All our time is precious. We have but one life to live here, and we are to make the most of it... We cannot afford to live without preparing for the future life. We have no time to waste" (*Testimonies for the Church*, vol. 2, p. 267).

## Time and the Final Crisis

Eschatological urgency intensifies time stewardship's importance. Jesus counseled: "We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; the night is coming when no one can work" (John 9:4). Ellen White applied this to end times: "We have no time to lose. The end is near... Now is the time to prepare" (*Testimonies for the Church*, vol. 6, p. 404-405).

If Christ's return is imminent, if the time to prepare and share truth is short, if souls hang in the balance—how does endless scrolling fit into that reality? It doesn't. Time thus wasted is time stolen not just from individual flourishing but from kingdom work.

This isn't about anxious striving or joyless productivity. Rest is biblical. Recreation is appropriate. But infinite scroll isn't true rest, and mindless consumption isn't valuable recreation. It's simply time vanishing without purpose—unconscionable when "the night is coming when no one can work."

## Practical Time-Redeeming Strategies

**Morning routine without devices**: Beginning the day with prayer and Scripture rather than scrolling sets tone for intentional living. What fills the mind first often dominates the day.

**Designated device times**: Rather than constant availability, check devices at scheduled times—perhaps morning, lunch, and evening. This focuses consumption into bounded periods rather than allowing it to interrupt all day.

**One-touch rule**: When picking up a device, complete intended task and immediately set it down. No "just quickly checking" other apps.

**Replace scrolling with specific alternatives**: Having a book ready, a project prepared, or a walk planned prevents the vacuum that scrolling fills by default.

**Tracking actual usage**: Most people drastically underestimate screen time. Using built-in trackers (Screen Time, Digital Wellbeing) or third-party apps reveals true usage, often motivating change.

**Environmental design**: Keeping devices in other rooms, using physical alarm clocks instead of phones, and creating device-free zones reduces opportunity for mindless use.

## The Eternal Perspective

Time stewardship ultimately concerns eternal realities. The temporal choices—how hours are spent, whether time is redeemed or wasted—have eternal consequences. Character is formed in daily choices. Habits established now prepare for (or undermine) faithfulness in earth's final crisis.

Ellen White wrote: "Eternity stretches before us. The curtain is about to be lifted. But a few short years, and for every one of us who is now living the great controversy will be ended... Our position in the world is not final. We are nearing the borders of the eternal world" (*Testimonies for the Church*, vol. 8, p. 252).

With eternity in view, an hour scrolling social media appears for what it is—not harmless entertainment but time stolen from preparation, service, growth, and witness. Stewardship means living each day aware that time is finite, opportunities are limited, and Christ's return approaches.

## Conclusion: Faithful Stewards of Time

Infinite scroll interfaces represent one of digital age's greatest threats to time stewardship. By design, they capture attention and consume hours without delivering commensurate value. For Christians committed to redeeming time, these platforms pose serious spiritual danger.

The solution isn't merely better time management techniques but theological grounding in stewardship. Time belongs to God. Every hour is a gift requiring faithful use. Life is too short and Christ's return too near for countless hours to vanish into scrolling feeds.

May Seventh-day Adventists model intentional time use. May we demonstrate that abundant life comes through purpose, not mindless consumption. May our schedules reflect kingdom priorities rather than algorithmic manipulation. And may we redeem time while opportunity remains, knowing that soon the night comes when no one can work—and when no amount of scrolling will have prepared anyone for eternity.
