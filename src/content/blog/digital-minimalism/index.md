# Digital Minimalism: Principles and Practices

Digital minimalism applies minimalist philosophy to technology use—intentionally choosing tools that serve genuine values while eliminating digital clutter and distraction.

## Core Principles

**Intentionality**: Use technology to support what you value, not because it's there or others use it.

**Optimization**: For each tool kept, optimize usage to maximize benefits and minimize costs.

**Quality over quantity**: Better to use few tools deeply than many tools shallowly.

## The Decluttering Process

1. Take a 30-day break from optional technologies
2. During the break, identify what you actually miss versus habit
3. Reintroduce only technologies that significantly serve important values
4. Establish usage rules for each reintroduced tool

## Common Decluttering Targets

- Social media accounts rarely checked or providing minimal value
- News apps creating anxiety without actionable information
- Messaging platforms fragmenting communication
- Subscription services barely used
- Games and entertainment apps filling time without satisfaction

## Optimization Strategies

For tools you keep:
- Set specific time limits
- Use only on certain devices or locations
- Batch usage to scheduled times
- Disable notifications
- Customize to reduce engagement features (unfollow accounts, mute groups)

## The Outcome

Digital minimalism creates space for focused attention on what matters. Freed from constant digital demands, users rediscover sustained concentration, meaningful relationships, and purposeful leisure.

It's not about using less technology but using technology less mindlessly.
