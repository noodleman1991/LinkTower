# Web Accessibility: Building for Everyone

Accessible websites aren't just legally compliant—they're better designed, more maintainable, and reach wider audiences. Understanding accessibility fundamentals benefits all users, not just those with disabilities.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Over 1 billion people worldwide have disabilities. Many rely on assistive technologies like screen readers, keyboard navigation, or voice control. Inaccessible websites exclude these users entirely.

Beyond the moral imperative, accessibility is often legally required. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to websites, and lawsuits have increased dramatically. Building accessibility in from the start prevents costly retrofitting.

## Core Principles: POUR

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) organize around four principles:

**Perceivable**: Information must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. This includes text alternatives for images, captions for videos, and sufficient color contrast.

**Operable**: Interface components must be operable. All functionality should work with keyboard alone, users need enough time to read content, and nothing should cause seizures.

**Understandable**: Information and operation must be understandable. This means clear language, predictable navigation, and helpful error messages.

**Robust**: Content must work with current and future technologies, including assistive devices.

## Quick Wins

Simple changes dramatically improve accessibility:

- Use semantic HTML (`<button>` not `<div onclick>`)
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Make all functionality keyboard accessible
- Label form inputs properly
- Use heading hierarchy correctly
- Ensure links have descriptive text (not "click here")

These practices require minimal effort but eliminate major barriers.

## Testing Approaches

Regular accessibility testing prevents issues:

- Use browser DevTools accessibility audits
- Test keyboard navigation without a mouse
- Run automated tools like axe or WAVE
- Use screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) to experience content
- Include users with disabilities in testing

Automated tools catch only 30-40% of issues. Manual testing and user feedback are essential.

## Accessibility Enhances Everyone's Experience

Accessible design benefits all users:

- Captions help people in noisy environments or watching without sound
- Keyboard shortcuts speed up power users' workflows
- Clear language helps non-native speakers
- Good contrast helps users in bright sunlight
- Semantic structure helps everyone scan content

Building for accessibility builds better websites for everyone.

## Conclusion

Web accessibility isn't a checklist to complete but a mindset to adopt. When accessibility informs design from the beginning, it becomes natural rather than burdensome.

The web was created to be accessible to everyone. As developers, we have the responsibility and opportunity to keep it that way.
