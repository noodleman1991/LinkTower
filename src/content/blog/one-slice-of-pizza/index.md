title: Famine Dream
description: The menu prices were from $1,000 - $8,000 per dish. I was there with several friends. I ate one slice of pizza, with a sharp and creamy vegan cheese, which very clearly and distinctly reminded me of the vegan cheese pizza I had at 8 at Trinity. Their current vegan menu items are around the $20-30 mark.

I hope this one is just me... But I need to remember interpretations belong to God. And as I think of it, I think of 2 dreams related to this, where prices in service stations became exorbitant. In the first of these, a bag of doritos cost me a few hundred dollars, and later I saw a great spiritual movement represented as a freight train. In the second of these, I saw a shopping complex in Australia which was wrapped with plastic cling wrap (which is used to protect and to preserve), yet they still fell into disrepair and abandonment, so that most by far went out of business.

Last night in care group, the lesson was from Gen 41, where Joseph interprets Pharaoh's dream about the coming famine. During the week, I studied this dream in my devotions. I also studied Acts 11:27-30, where Agabus the prophet predicts a great famine. These are the most recent passages I studied in both Acts and Genesis.

I was out for dinner, having fine dining at a vegan restaurant. The menu prices were from $1,000 - $8,000 per dish. I was there with several friends. I ate one slice of pizza, with a sharp and creamy vegan cheese, which very clearly and distinctly reminded me of the vegan cheese pizza I had at 8 at Trinity. Their current vegan menu items are around the $20-30 mark. I felt anxious and troubled, feeling that it was not proper to eat out at a place so expensive. Also to note, the owners of 8 at Trinity have, this year, opened 7 at Avondale.

Then, I was at the supermarket, at Coles at the checkout at Coles. There were two girls at the ckeckout, one taking over from another. I was hearing how Coles was going out of business, and I was hearing the reason for it. I wish I could remember the words spoken, but I cannot; however I recall the general sentiment. The reason, generally speaking, was not due to Coles management making poor business decisions, but because they were fighting a very difficult fight to stay afloat. They were able to respond to this crisis in a controlled manner, perhaps over a series of several months. Woolworths was able to stay in business at this time.
