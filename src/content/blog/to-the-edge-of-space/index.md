title: To the Edge of Space
description: God wants us to have the kind of trust to hang onto Him even when it sounds scary, when it appears utterly impossible, but by the power of God it is possible. It’s a matter trust in the pilot that we love dearly, and who loves us dearly. Our Pilot Jesus Christ longs to take us into space itself, but we protest that we aren’t ready for that. And so He waits because He loves us.

I had a dream that I was a part of a demonstration of sorts. There were people fighting in different parts of the world, and I was at this particular place. There was a plane, and I was hanging onto the plane with my bare arms. No harness, no parachute, nothing, just my arms hugging onto this plane. It would launch into the sky, and then land back down. It looked like a passenger plane but it was being used like a military plane. I know the one who my soul loves was the one piloting it. It would launch up into the sky and I would be hanging on for dear life and then it would land back down in front of some other people who were invested in or attached to this in some way or another. The end goal of this program was to reach to the edge of the atmosphere, and I was asked if I was ready to do that run. I said “I’m still just hanging on with my arms? I don’t think I’m ready for this!” And so we did another couple of runs up, still pretty high but not as high as the edge of the atmosphere, as we had been doing before. Then the time came to go for it, and I was ready. I hung on, and it felt just like the other times. 

I know what it means. It’s a beautiful illustration of the 144,000. God wants us to have the kind of trust to hang onto Him even when it sounds scary, when it appears utterly impossible, but by the power of God it is possible. It’s a matter trust in the pilot that we love dearly, and who loves us dearly. Our Pilot Jesus Christ longs to take us into space itself, but we protest that we aren’t ready for that. And so He waits because He loves us. But He just longs to take us home properly, for good. Amen.
