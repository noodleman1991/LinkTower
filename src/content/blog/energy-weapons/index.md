title: Energy Weapons
description: But then I heard screams in the distance, and standing as high as I could I saw three aircraft hovering over the city, and using energy weapons directed down at the city. Two of them had red beams and one had a golden beam. I could hear screams and knew they were attacking people.

Yesterday in my distress I had a burning question of my heart unto God, and I asked Him if He could show me something in answer to this. I do not remember the question, and I don't think this directly answers it, but I believe it is His response.

At first I was in a video game. Once I made it to a certain point, I could drive around exceptionally fast in a car due to use of a special ability. It must have been several times the speed of the currently fastest cars, and I was surprised that I was still able to control it at speed.

Then I saw something about how you could have up to three of these computer controlled helpers, like NPC companions. They had different skills you could have them develop. One of them was coding, and it was observed that you could become the best coder without knowing how to code yourself, but simply by developing other skills and having the robot companion do the coding — or at least that's how people at the top did it. I then saw that the person highest on the leaderboards for coding had zero coding skill themselves, but rather had business skills, and had a computer controlled helper who had become the best coder.

Then I was no longer in a video game. I was outside the house, in the outer areas of the city. There were a few planes flying overhead, not commercial passenger planes but high speed jets. The thought was entertained that it could be a sign of war, but the thought sounded ridiculous. Then one of them had these large panels from the side which moved down to point downwards, and the plane was hovering in place, and a great beam of light shone downwards. I thought it must be a search light, they must be looking for someone. But then I heard screams in the distance, and standing as high as I could I saw three aircraft hovering over the city, and using energy weapons directed down at the city. Two of them had red beams and one had a golden beam. I could hear screams and knew they were attacking people. I wanted to get out of there but my first thought was actually to video it on my phone and send out a short video to warn people on platforms like X.

I woke with a sense of urgency to warn people somehow.

I still don’t remember what my question was, but it seems God’s answer was that people need to be warned about UAPs, and possibly these other technological advances may be connected to UAPs.
