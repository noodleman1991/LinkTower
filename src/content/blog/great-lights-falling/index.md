title: Great Lights Falling
description: We were hesitant to do anything about these great lights, for we feared what light would remain if we would not have these lights; yet it became clear to us that we needed to address this problem. The next thing I saw was that these great lights were dislodged from the ceiling without hands.

We began our journey on a landmass, I know not how large. There was, as it were, a large bridge proceeding out from this land to cross over the waters. It was raised above the ground and above the waters, and by the Waters' edge one could pass by underneath this bridge, and there were a great many people lining up to cross this bridge. Later I was able to see that this bridge led not to another landmass but to a great ship; however I could not see this yet and only perceived that this was a bridge.

I had been in the line, with Jojo at my side, but as we were joining onto the bridge I was reminded of something which I must bring with me, which I was required to go and fetch, even though this meant I would have to rejoin the line at the end once more. Three times this happened, such that I was much delayed in boarding the ship, and was now much behind Jojo in climbing aboard.

Eventually as we progressed along the bridge we reached the point where it met the great ship, and I perceived the goal of the bridge for the first time. There was a small crew helping us to climb aboard; we had to come down from the bridge, down a set of stairs, and there were certain things we must leave behind. I lingered somewhat at this stage, observing and providing some little assistance.

Then we were aboard the ship, and travelled far from whence we departed. However, there were troubles aboard the ship, and we could not cleanly identify the source of the problems. The ship was unable to progress forwards in its journey as it lacked the power. Not far beyond us was a new land, a high land, a bright land, like the bright ice cliffs of Antarctica, yet simultaneously it was lush and green, with a gentle shoreline we could easily ascend. However, there was still a little water we must cross before we could meet this new land.

We stagnated in our journey for some time, and the problems remained unidentified and unaddressed. Before we knew it, we could not longer see the new land, but only cruel, violent waters all around us. Then we identified that the problem was as lightning, a strange energy permeating right through the ship. We looked further, and investigated the source, and somehow identified it in many of the great lights set in the uppermost ceiling of the ship.

We were hesitant to do anything about these great lights, for we feared what light would remain if we would not have these lights; yet it became clear to us that we needed to address this problem. The next thing I saw was that these great lights were dislodged from the ceiling without hands, falling one after another through the empty expanse of the full height of the ship, and crashing down into the waters in the lowest part of the ship.
