Which animal had the greatest prayer experience? Not the Tigger who jumps around, but the Red Fox 2, a creature made to glide.

---

There were four animals in question: a Tigger who was full of energy and bounced around on his tail, two other animals, and Red Fox 2, which looked red as a fox but like a sugar glider had a membrane between its wrists and ankles which enabled it to glide through the air.

At first the Tigger bounced along this dirt path with level grassland all around, and it's bouncing was not high enough to give it a meaningful advantage in travelling along the path. The path then began to wind back and forth in the midst of denser greenery, winding down gradually on the side of a steep hill.

The Tigger then came to its first major obstacle - some workmen were doing some kind of construction work on the path and had temporarily blocked the way forward. On the first point the Tigger had to wait patiently until the workman had done his work.

Then, instead of the Tigger travelling down this path, there was a small wheeled vehicle, capable of significantly faster speeds but had relatively low clearance and thus had little ability to pass obstacles. Very soon it came to a large section of the path which had either collapsed down the hillside or been dug out, and the workmen had marked it with a yellow tagged temporary fence to keep travellers from danger. There was a little remaining width on the path to the left, but the wheeled vehicle looked too wide for it, and had already picked up too much speed to stop in time. Fortunately when it got closer it found the remaining path was wider than first thought and it was able to continue along the way.

Finally, the path came to a great excavation, a large spherical area of raw brown dirt dug out from the earth. There was no more path, and looking forward was a messy construction zone and a steep descent down from the hill which the path had remained on the side of up to this point. It was at this point that Red Fox 2 was seen.

The small fuzzy red animal bravely leaped out into the air, with its gliding membranes outstretched. At first it descended steeply, and appeared to be in great danger, but as it fell and picked up speed, it's ability to glide strengthened. Its momentum remained yet was redirected to a shallower angle of descent, such that it's flight path was now almost level, and it appeared that soon it would even be gaining altitude.

The four animals represent four stages in the Christian journey. The Tigger represents the young Christian, and the Red Fox 2 the mature Christian worker, strengthened with the ability to take great leaps of faith. The animals which are not seen represent stages in between these. The greatest prayer experience is not the one which appears the most level, but the one which by faith overcomes the greatest obstacles.
