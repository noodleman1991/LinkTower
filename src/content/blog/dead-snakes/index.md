Last night I prayed that God would help me understand with confidence whether a dream or message was from Him or not. This dream that I had this morning is a response to that.

I was lying in bed, except my bed was in a different arrangement to how it is in reality. There were tubes, perhaps half the diameter of a pool noodle, more flexible, plain white, and soundless. I don't know where they were coming from - my covers, mattress, under my bed, or even somewhere else - but the ends of them were in reach of me.

One by one, I would take the tubes in my hands, and squeeze them, then out would come a small head like that of a snake, with mouth frozen wide open. Bodies of various lengths would then follow. Some tubes were already clean, others had a short snake, others had a longer snake. However, all of these snakes were lifeless as they were squeezed from the tubes, and their venom would be neutralised and turn to vapour as they were extracted.

Before I had begun squeezing these tubes, I had called on my mother for help, because a girl was coming over soon; I liked her, but I was yet to publically admit her. I believed myself to be unwell, and that both a gas mask and face shield would be required. I believed the vapours from the snakes in my bed were a cumulative toxin that I needed to protect this girl from; I believed myself to be contagious and even harmful in my condition. 

However, over time I realised that the venom of the snakes had been neutralised, cleansed. There was a pool of water building up from the floor of my room, perhaps 30-40cm deep. The water was clean. The Spirit of God was present and active in this cleansing power.

Then finally before I woke, I drew out a very long snake, so long that I wondered perhaps if it had no end. Yet even this mighty serpent was of none effect! It was no match for the purifying power present in my bedroom.

God will cleanse my dreams from the attacks of the enemy. No power of evil can overcome this. It will not be permitted. For the sake of the people I must know what I can trust, and in this I can trust. This work has already started, within the past year. I believe my memories of dreams that were not of God have been held from me; I may have experienced them in the moment, but I was not permitted to remember them any longer, that they may not detract from the authority of that which God has revealed.

I am not above the law that I may judge it, nor am I above the Spirit that I may judge its allocation of gifts. It is not my place to determine or decide the size and scope of my mission; that is the prerogative of God the Father alone.

Lord have mercy on me.
