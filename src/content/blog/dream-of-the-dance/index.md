Before getting into the body of this particular dream, it's quite important to understand the context. I had this dream back in 2019, a time which marks the beginning of the journey where God led me to the woman of my dreams. At this time, as I was recovering from my first girlfriend breaking up with me, I began to really submit my love life to God as I sought His leading. I realised that I didn't know what would truly satisfy me in a life partner, and needed Him to lead me to the woman who He knew would be best for me.

One thing I did was to prayerfully journal and write out a long list of things I was looking for in a future wife. There were many things that I thought I wanted that, while refining this list, I realised didn't really matter. Between various versions of lists, I had some 70 qualities in consideration, all of which are satisfied by the beautiful woman who is now my wife. She is everything I asked God for and more.

Alongside the prayer, journalling and list-making, I also began to have dreams which I believe God used to reveal identifying characteristics of this woman He had in store for me. There were at least 25 dreams that hinted at things in some way. This dream is the first one I clearly understood to show something about her.

I must admit that I actually doubted things would really play out as depicted here. Perhaps this was out of pride, thinking that surely I would recognise her as soon as I met her and wouldn't find myself looking elsewhere as this dream depicted. I theorised that perhaps this dream showed things from her perspective to help me understand what was happening in her heart. However, for all my lofty thoughts of how quickly I would identify her, my theory proved incorrect and it played out just as shown here.

I was at a tame party in a mid sized hall. There were a few dozen people there, mostly dancing in pairs. At first I was floating around with another guy, who was pretending to be a socially awkward television character.

Then I began dancing with a girl; she was pretty, but otherwise unexceptional. I was enjoying myself, but there wasn’t anything serious between us.

Then I noticed *the* girl, and something about her immediately captured my attention. She was by herself and seemed sad, and my heart was stirred with sympathy. After a short hesitation, I went over to talk with her, and then I woke up. I knew that she was the girl that God was leading me to.

I saw this dream fulfilled in 2023 during my time at AFCOE, a three-month Bible worker training program held in Melbourne. I didn't do any literal dancing at this time, the dancing hall of the dream is merely a frame which presented me as looking for my partner. Through the course, I'd had my eye on one particular girl in our class, and was actually thinking maybe she was the girl of my dreams. However, despite my best efforts to win her affections, she didn't seem to feel the same way, and I didn't foresee any opportunity to spend more time with her after the program. She was the girl I was "dancing" with. She was not the exceptional match for me that I was looking for.

Before I began dancing with her, I wasn't dancing with some other girl, but rather I was shown hanging around with a guy who I couldn't meaningfully relate to. The way this played out was that before developing interest in her, there was a period of time in which I wasn't pursuing any girl, and I had social needs that my male friends weren't able to meet.

Though my attention was absorbed in this one girl, there was another classmate, Jojo, who I was quietly developing a strong friendship with. We often spent time together after class, comforted and helped each other when we were down, and one time she drove me to visit my Nanna on one of our days off. I didn't have any romantic interest in her, but we had actually grown quite close.

On April 16, it was the day after our graduation ceremony and the end of the program. Soon I would need to make the long drive back north to Newcastle where I would begin Bible working in a few days' time. I was willing to linger in Melbourne for a day if some of our classmates wanted to do something together, otherwise I would begin the drive back. Though I could have joined an event where the other girl would be, it somehow didn't interest me. However, Jojo had been suggesting that I find another time to visit my Nanna before leaving, and we ended up deciding to visit her together again.

After talking with my Nanna for a bit, we sang some hymns together, and recounted the heart-moving story behind *It Is Well*. Jojo then burst into tears, and at first we thought it was just because she was moved by the song. As the tears continued to flow, it was clear there was something deeper at play - she was sad that I would be leaving. I was moved with compassion for her, and couldn't bear the thought that our last memory together would end like this. I was determined that I would give her a good memory of our last time together, whatever it took. We went to the Geelong waterfront together, and in hindsight we consider this to be our first date.

That night, my heart was torn between Jojo and this other girl. I had been pursuing the other girl and thought that I still liked her, and thought that some of the dreams matched up with her, yet it didn't seem to be going anywhere. Also, in my mind I had only thought of Jojo as a close friend, but now I was starting to wonder if I wanted her to be more than a friend to me. I knew that I needed wisdom from above, and for God to lead me rather than trying to find an answer by listening to my feelings.

I knelt down and prayed "God, open my heart to whoever my heart is supposed to be open to, and close my heart to whoever my heart is supposed to be closed to." I fully expected God to close my heart to both Jojo and this other girl, that I would just leave them behind and focus on Bible working, and that would be the end of it. However, after praying this, my heart was growing more closed towards the other girl and more open and warm towards Jojo. I didn't want to be tricked by my feelings, as the Bible tells us our heart is deceitful, so I prayed the same prayer a second time, submitting my heart before God and His will. After praying the second time, this same effect seem to be growing stronger, of my heart opening towards Jojo and closing towards the other girl. I still wasn't quite satisfied, so I prayed a third time, "God, open my heart to whoever my heart is supposed to be open to, and close my heart to whoever my heart is supposed to be closed to." At this point I had lost any special interest in this other girl and my heart was filled with warmth towards Jojo. Though I was slow to realise it, God was beginning to show me that Jojo was the one He was leading me towards.

Though I had been "dancing" with another girl, the time came that I saw Jojo weeping. My heart was moved with sympathy for her, I forgot all about my interest in that other girl, and as I woke up to what God was doing I realised that Jojo was the one God had in store for me. I had no idea at the time that it was being fulfilled, but in hindsight it is very clear.

Sometimes we think we know what we're looking for, that we don't have to be told what will make us happy, that we know ourselves better than anyone else does. As I found out, this simply isn't true; the God who formed us in our mother's womb knows much better than we do what will truly satisfy the longing of our heart. If you haven't yet submitted your happiness to Him, take a moment to pray and ask Him to help you trust Him with this. Our Heavenly Father is the God of love, and His purpose for all of His children is to give them lasting happiness. My prayer is that this purpose of His may be accomplished in your life. Amen.
