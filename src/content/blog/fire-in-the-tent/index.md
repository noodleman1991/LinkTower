This is the good part of a long and meandering dream. Yesterday someone asked me if I was a prophet and I didn't have a response, and he said like it would suck to be a prophet because then you'd have dreams and you'd wake up and you'd have to write them down.

I guess I have to write this down.

I was in the wilderness leading a group of people. I found some kind of old building to use for our home base, so we decided to set up a sort of camp there. We didn't have walls, we didn't have a roof, but we had people, and we had a fire. Despite a lack of tangible shelter, I knew we were protected. We were actually happy, and had gratitude for where we were.

Then we saw our neighbours. There was a tall strong fence separating us from them. They had a nice barn, with doors, a roof, and someone else leading them, and there was a wide, smooth road leading just along the other side of the fence up to the doors where they were greeted and let inside, and they were singing something that sounded like hymns.

I saw that these people looked like they had more than us, they seemed happy, they seemed to be growing in number, but something about their situation didn't seem real. It didn't seem true for them to be in the wilderness yet have such creature comforts.

Then a little later, I was meeting with some young men from this other group, and they were saying they liked my work, the things that I had accomplished, and respected me as one of their peers and an example for them to follow. (that doesn't express the felt sentiment perfectly). However, I was confused, because it was literally nothing I had done, but all done by my father. (in the dream my father was Michael Bay and they were talking about movies, but I knew Michael Bay to be significantly older than me).

I think this represents how in the final days to come I may have some sort of leadership role over a small-medium flock. We will see those deceived with their worldly comforts, but find assurance in the fact that we are not deceived. It will be literally absolute zero of my doing, and 100% all by my heavenly Father.

Then I had another dream section to share. I remembered the pieces in between when I woke up, and wondered how they might be important, but I knew the importance of writing things down if needed, so I stayed up. Now, these are the only two sections I remember, the important parts. This confirms to me that these are the important parts.

I was part of a tent meeting, of a series called Share. It was full of teens and young adults. I was older than them. Then, off to the side, a fire started in the grass, and began to grow. I immediately stepped up to put out the fire lest it grow.

I tried to stomp it out with my shoes, but at first this was ineffective and it only seemed to grow. I then got down and started scraping up dirt to heap on the fire, and continued stomping the smaller parts, until it was finally put out.

There were many onlookers who failed to help. There was one at my side who was unable to help but provided encouragement. After putting out the hazardous flames, I was recovering from the stress and pressure of the situation, and sought to find some relief and wash my hands of the dirt. However, my efforts were thwarted; there was hand sanitiser available, but there were long lines for the bathrooms. Apparently everyone else was lining up to wash their hands first, when they didn't even help, didn't even get their hands dirty!

Then while lining up I saw a man arrive who didn't even have hands, but stumps on the ends of his arms, and some sort of deformity around his feet as well. He was already speaking to a man at the door with a black shirt, a responsible man, but all others were ignoring him on account of his deformities. I felt uncomfortable and didn't want to approach him either but I had to. The dream ended as I was introducing myself.

The young people in the tent are God's people. **They perish for lack of action**. “These are my people” says the Lord. “Feed them.”

I will be required to put out fires. I will be required to live in discomfort because of the selfishness of the professed people of God. I will be required to do unto the Least of these even when I would rather not, and the masses around me fail to notice them. God taught me this lesson through my childhood loneliness and through my mother; leave nooone unwelcomed.
