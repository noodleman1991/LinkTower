# The Economics of Attention in Digital Platforms

Attention has become the internet's most valuable commodity. Understanding the economic forces driving platform design reveals why digital wellness remains difficult.

## The Advertising Model

Most free platforms monetize through advertising. More user attention means more ad impressions and higher revenue. This business model creates incentives to maximize time on platform, regardless of user wellbeing.

## Engagement Metrics

Platforms optimize for engagement—likes, shares, comments, time spent. These metrics correlate with advertising revenue but not user satisfaction or welfare. Features that addict users succeed by business metrics even if they harm users psychologically.

## The Algorithmic Feed

Algorithms curate content to maximize engagement, often promoting outrage, controversy, and polarization because these emotional reactions drive more interaction. Truth, nuance, and user wellbeing aren't optimization targets.

## Alternative Models

Subscription services align incentives differently—satisfied subscribers renew, so platforms optimize for satisfaction rather than addiction. This explains why paid services often respect users' time better than ad-supported ones.

## User Agency

Understanding economic incentives helps users recognize when platforms serve shareholders over users. This knowledge supports conscious choices about which platforms to use and how to use them.

The attention economy isn't going away, but informed users can resist its worst manipulations.
